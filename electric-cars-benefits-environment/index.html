Fast Facts About Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2020 From in.pinterest.com</p>
<p>Multiple studies have found that electric cars are more efficient, and therefore responsible for less greenhouse gas and other emissions than cars powered solely by internal combustion engines. The following guide will walk you through the top benefits of electric cars, and how they not only help the environment but save you money on driving costs in the long run. The environmental benefits of electric cars? The battery does add to their environmental footprint, but not much. They have the potential to revolutionize how energy is used, created and redirected.</p>
<h3 id="they-can-reduce-emissions-and-even-save-you-money">They can reduce emissions and even save you money.</h3><p>Manufacturing them does generate some co2 emissions and the amount of co2 they generate in use depends very much on how the electricity used to charge them was generated. Here are six ways electric cars are better for the environment: However, they have also proven to have many more benefits to society. Electric cars are predicted to be the next disruptive market force for transportation and technology. 6 benefits of electric cars.</p>

They have the potential to revolutionize how energy is used, created and redirected. Realistically, we’d need everyone to switch to electric cars to see a reduction in co2 levels and while this may be doable in the future, it’s unlikely to happen now. In norway electric cars are often as cheap, or cheaper to buy than internal combustion engine cars, due to tax incentives.
