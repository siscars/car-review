<p>This is a genuine Metallifacture Jaguar E-Type jack. Vintage Automobile Model T Jack Model No. Vintage 1920s Screw Jack Industrial Jack Farm Jack Flip Top Mechanical Jack Car Jack Mechanics Jack Way back when before roads were paved screw jacks were an essential tool to carry in your car. Our car has some early 26 features on it so its possible it was a 25 jack that they simply used up on the early 26s. The Model WA-20 Lo Way Jack only required 6 of clearance - important for those early cars. Ive re-assembled the tool kit except for the jack with that nice brass name plate on it.
