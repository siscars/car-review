<p>Like the classic it is expected to be maintained or restored to original specs whenever possible. If however you ask HMRC for a definition then its anything thats at least 15 years old and worth a minimum of 15000. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. The car should also be maintained in a way to keep it true to its original specifications form the manufacturer or if theyve been modified they must be modified back to its original manufacturer specifications. But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition. States often have a special type of license plate for these cars.

<p>The difference in classification comes down to how you use it. Some states though allow cars to be classified as antique or classic in just 20 years while others require it to be older. You can use the same standard to call it vintage which means about the same thing. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car.

<p>Some dealers are attempting to lower the standard. The combination of these features will determine if you have a classic car or if you have a valuable classic car. An antique car is a classification that is often set by state law. State DMVs insurance companies and classic car clubs classify each one differently.
