<p>But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition. Does having original parts make your classic car worth more. They believe that items over 50 years old should be considered an antique. An antique car is defined as a car that was originally manufactured at least 39 years ago according to California law.

<p>States may also have their own rules to define. Generally speaking antique cars are 45 years or older while classic cars are 20 years or older. Vehicles that are used for private purposes and manufactured in 1945 or in the previous years will be considered ancient vehicles.

If you honestly feel that an item is over 100 years in age after doing your homework then describe it as an antique. There is a difference between these three classified cars though antique plates can apply to all of them. The Classic Car Club of America on the other hand defines a classic vehicle as a Fine or Distinctive vehicle thats American or foreign built and was produced only between 1915 and 1948.
