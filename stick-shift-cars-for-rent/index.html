It’s difficult to find a manual transmission car to rent because rental car companies prefer to carry vehicles that anyone can drive — manual cars become a liability when inexperienced stick shift drivers rent them. Others in my family won’t even attempt to drive it because it’s so finnicky. Driving in ireland, Ireland travel, Ireland vacation.</p>

<p>I am looking for a rental car company that rents stick shift. You cannot use rental cars to train drivers on how to drive with a stick shift, as stated in the terms and conditions. Im trying to get some more practice driving stick, and i don�t know anyone with a stick shift. Typical 5 speed manual gear shifter. Despite the decreasing popularity of manual transmission cars in the u.s., some rental car companies still provide them. For many driving enthusiasts, arranging a manual transmission car rental in europe is akin to a pilgrimage to mecca. Chemical Leaman R Model 2670 in 2020 Trucks, Mack.</p>
