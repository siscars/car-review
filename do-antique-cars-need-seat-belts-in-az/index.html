Many cars were manufactured without them prior to new legislation introduced in 1983 that required passengers to wear seat belts. Unless your car is a very old classic car then its unlikely your vehicle wont have seat belts. Section 106 HTA requires drivers and passengers to occupy a seating position in a motor vehicle as opposed to sitting in the cargo area of a van and wear the complete seatbelt assembly. After 1965 every car that carries passengers is required to have at least two shoulder harness type belts in each passenger seat as well as all front seat positions.
