The ride is comparable to the original Les Taxis antique car ride combining nostalgia with new enhancements. A little rainy on preview night for Gold Pass members but still a lot of fun. These were one of my favorite rides to do as a kid at Kings Island back in the day.

Back on August 16th Kings Island announced that they would be bringing back the antique car ride a ride that was removed from the park 14 years ago in 2004.
