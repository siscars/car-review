<p>Generally speaking a classic car is a vehicle thats over 20 years old. The first thing you will need to find out is what qualifies as a vintage antique historic or classic car. Pennsylvania title procedures require that out-of-state certificates of title be surrendered to the Bureau of Motor. Antique vehicles operated exclusively between sunrise and sunset are exempt from the normal lighting requirements of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code but must have their original lighting equipment. VADMV will accept almost any antique YOM plate application and will often ask someone registering a 25 year old car if they know their vehicle is eligible for those plates.

<p>This means you would have a Passenger plate registration to go along with your Antique plate registration. Research your states particular guidelines in advance of registering it if you didnt before you bought the car. You might get lucky if you search for a title but if the car was last titled or registered more than 10 years ago. If your vehicle is leased youll also need the Application for Lessee Information Form MV-1L which must be completed by the lessor. Cars with an antique plate shall be used only for participation in club activities exhibits tours parades and similar uses but in no event shall it be used for general transportation according to the Delaware DMV. This means you would have a Passenger plate registration to go along with your Antique plate registration. Pin On سيارات قديمة.</p>
