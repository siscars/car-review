<p>Since 1957 this is one of the largest antique car shows and flea markets in the world with 10400 spaces. Vaughns car was totaled but luckily the historic old truck and the trailer it rode in were unharmed and made it safely to the antiques show. The spaces are to be used to sell parts however some use the space to park their vehicle instead of using the parking lots. The Hershey Region began hosting the show in 1955 and has done so each year since then. If you arrive at 3 and the Hersheypark parking area is full because it is a busy day you will be directed to park in the Giant Center lot which is what happened to most of the people that were stuck for an extended period of time at the 1D concert last week. They also sell spaces for just cars that are for sale normally antique or special interest. Pin By Aaca Museum On Checker Car Club Car Club Antique Cars Car.</p>
